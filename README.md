# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction

Crypto Predict (Working title) is my chosen project for my 4th year of college.

The aim of the project is to be able to predict with some degree of accuracy the future prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. However it is intended to be designed in a manner that it would be simple for any Developer to implement any Cryptocurrency they wish.

## Installation
1. Clone the project.
`git clone https://github.com/AdamsEatin/Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to directory
`cd Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-master`
3. Install the requirements.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- By running the Data_Collection.py script you will be able to download fresh data on top of the provided datasets. Note however that as of writing (16/01/2018) you require at least 54003 data points. This will hopefully be reduced in future iterations.

-TBC
